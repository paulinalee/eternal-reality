Once you go past the forest, you will have to fight waves of enemies.
Defeating enemies drops points, which can be used to upgrade skills or restore your HP.
Upgrades and healing can be done between rounds. A round will end once a certain number of waves of enemies are defeated.
The map has multiple areas which will spawn enemies periodically. Pay attention, since some enemies can come from behind!
